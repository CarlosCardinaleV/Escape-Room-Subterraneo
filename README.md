The game **Escape Room Subterráneo** is a challenge where a team of three players will be tested for their ability to progress as far as possible in a tournament of strategy, survival, and escape. Each team member receives three magical gems, and together they must strive to escape their confinement by creating spells that are cast on the locks of the three exit doors, located in each of the three consecutive caverns.

## Objective

The main objective of the game is to open the exit doors in each cave, successfully escaping the underground depths. However, there are several challenges to face:

- The magical gems may lose their power over time, adding an element of urgency and strategy to the game.
- There's a risk of a player dying if all of their gems completely lose their power.
- Lack of oxygen in the cave can also lead to a player's demise.

1. Each team is composed of three players.
