## Description

**Underground Escape Room** is a strategic survival challenge designed for a three-player team. Players are tested on their ability to navigate a series of underground caverns by crafting spells to unlock reinforced doors. 

Each team member begins with three magical gems. Together, you must manage your resources, maintain your health, and solve the mysteries of the deep to reach the surface.

## Objective

The primary goal is to unlock the exit doors of three consecutive caverns and escape the underground depths. Success requires more than just speed; you must overcome several critical threats:

* **Gem Decay:** Magical gems lose power over time, requiring constant strategic management.
* **Player Vitality:** If a player's gems lose all power, they risk death.
* **Oxygen Depletion:** Limited air supply adds a layer of urgency to every decision.

## Gameplay Rules

1.  **Team Composition:** The game is balanced for exactly three players.
2.  **Initial Resources:** Every player is granted three magical gems at the start.
3.  **Progression:** There are three distinct caverns; each has a locked exit that requires a specific spell to open.
4.  **Resource Management:** Gems are a finite resource. Using them or simply letting time pass will reduce their potency.
5.  **Survival Conditions:** Players must balance the use of gems for spells against the energy needed to stay alive.
6.  **Collaboration:** Success is impossible alone. Players must synchronize their spellcasting and share resources to ensure the whole team escapes.
